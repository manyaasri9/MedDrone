        <h1>We Are Team MedDrone 🚁</h1>

        <p>
            Team MedDrone is a student-led vision of what healthcare could look like in 2036.
            We imagine a world where intelligent drones deliver life-saving medicine quickly,
            safely, and equitably — especially to communities that need it most.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            In our future, technology is not just advanced — it is meaningful.
            MedDrone Connect uses artificial intelligence, smart routing,
            and sustainable energy to ensure that distance or disaster
            never prevents someone from receiving urgent care.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Applied sciences can sometimes feel complex or intimidating.
            We designed this demo to make innovation feel accessible,
            hands-on, and exciting for K–12 students.
        </p>

        <p>
            By turning advanced systems into a simple interactive experience,
            we show that engineering and computing are tools for solving
            real human problems — not just writing code or building machines.
        </p>

        <h2>Powered by Collaboration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Computing:</strong> AI decision-making and smart routing</li>
            <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Safe and reliable drone systems</li>
            <li><strong>Mechatronics:</strong> Sensors and flight control</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Energy:</strong> Efficient battery optimization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            We want every student who interacts with MedDrone Connect to think:
        </p>

        <div class="mission-quote">
            “I could build something like this someday.”
        </div>

        <p>
            Applied sciences is for everyone. With curiosity, creativity,
            and collaboration, anyone can help build a better future.
